# K2NE ServiceBroker

## Introduction

The K2NE Service Broker provides common functionality that is used by a lot of projects, but is not provide by K2 out of the box.

Check out the [ChangeLog](Documentation/ChangeLog.adoc).

For other documentation on the functionality, see our [Documentation](Documentation/K2NEServiceBroker.adoc)


The code will be 'work in progress' for quite a while, but the functionality in our master branch is stable.

## Installation
At the moment, there is no installer.
To install:
- Download and open in Visual Studio (2013/2017)
- Build
- Open and/or copy the Release folder in the solution directory to the K2 server.
- Run install.ps1


You will now have a registered service type and can create a new service instance.
