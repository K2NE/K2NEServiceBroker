# K2NE ServiceBroker

## Introduction

The K2NE Service Broker provides common functionality that is used by a lot of projects, but is not provide by K2 out of the box.

Check out the [ChangeLog](Documentation/ChangeLog.adoc).

For other documentation on the functionality, see our [Documentation](Documentation/K2NEServiceBroker.adoc)


The code will be 'work in progress' for quite a while, but the functionality in our master branch is stable.

## Installation
The installer uses chocolatey, please see https://chocolatey.org/ on how to install that.

From that, you can simply run:
`cinst K2NEServiceBroker`
