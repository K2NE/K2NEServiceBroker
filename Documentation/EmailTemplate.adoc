# EmailTemplate

The primary goal of the Email Template ServiceObject is to allow K2 users to change Workflow Email and/or Task Notifications dynamically without the necessity to redeploy the workflow. Also the EmailTemplate service object can support multilanguage projects, where a user can load Email templates for a certain language.

## Contents

The overall logic of the SO uses the following components:

* EmailTemplateSO - loads the requested template and replaces the placeholders with the provided values;
* K2Field.K2NE.SMO.EmailTemplate - the smartobject, which stores Email Bodies and Subjects and is used by the EmailTemplateSO to retrieve data (**System Name: _K2Field_K2NE_SMO_EmailTemplate_**).

## Installation

1. Deploy the **K2Field.K2NE.SMO.EmailTemplate** SmartObject. You can find it in the K2NEServiceBroker solution.
2. Deploy **K2NEServiceBroker** and register the ServiceInstance.
3. If you need to use some custom input parameters for the placeholders, you can specify them in the Service Key **EmailTemplateCustomParameters** in the following format: _PlaceHolderName1;PlaceHolderName2;..._ - the placeholders will be %PlaceHolderName1%, %PlaceHolderName2%...

## Usage

##### Creation of Email Template

You can create Email Template with placeholders in Email Subjects and/or Bodies in the following format _%PlaceholderName%_
The Service Object uses several internal placeholders, the values of which are received from the workflow data:

* _%Process.Folio%_
* _%Process.Name%_
* _%Process.StartDate%_
* _%Process.Originator%_
* _%DataField.DatafieldName%_ (eg. %DataField.RequestId%, %DataField.ContractType%...)

In order to take advantage of the internal workflow data, you need to specify Process Instance Id as an input parameter for the SO methods.


##### Getting an Email Template

Static input parameters:

* Template Name - the name of the template;
* Template Language - Language of the template;
* Process Instance Id;

Other input parameters are created dynamically by splitting the Service Key **EmailTemplateCustomParameters**.

The code behind will take the first found EmailTemplate filtered by Template Name and Template Language. That is why you need to take care that your template Names/Languages are unique.

##### Inserting templates inside other templates as placeholders

You can use the whole template text as a replacement for placeholder in another template. This scenario is often used when you need to have headers/footers in your emails. In order to achive this, you need specify the placeholder in the following format: %Template._TemplateName_% 

**Since recursion is used to achive this, the level of recursion is limited and hardcoded to 3 levels. It means that the SO will go down only by 3 levels trying to find new templates inside other templates.**
