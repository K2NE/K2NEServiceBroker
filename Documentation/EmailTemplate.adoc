# EmailTemplate

The primary goal of the Email Template ServiceObject is to allow K2 users to change Workflow Email and/or Task Notifications dynamically without the necessity to redeploy the workflow. Also the EmailTemplate service object can support multilanguage projects, where a user can load Email templates for a certain language.

## Contents

The overall logic of the SO uses the following components:

* EmailTemplateSO - loads the requested template and replaces the placeholders with the provided values;
* K2Field.K2NE.SMO.EmailTemplate - the smartobject, which stores Email Templates and is used by the EmailTemplateSO.

## Installation

1. Deploy the **K2Field.K2NE.SMO.EmailTemplate** SmartObject. You can find it in the K2NEServiceBroker solution.
2. Deploy **K2NEServiceBroker** and register the ServiceInstance.
3. If you need to use some custom input parameters for the placeholders, you can specify them in the Service Key **EmailTemplateCustomParameters** in the following format: _PlaceHolderName1;PlaceHolderName2;..._

## Usage

##### Get Email Template
