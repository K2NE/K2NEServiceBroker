== Client API

=== Process Instance Client
A service object that generates a method for all the processes it can start. Be careful with permissions on processes here!
This allows us to start processes WITH a datafield.

=== Worklist
* Get Worklist: Retrieves the worklistitems for the current user. Any input will become a AND-filtered query, except for the 'IncludeShared' option, which indicates if shared worklist items should be retrieved as well.

=== Worklist item
* Release Worklist Item: release a worklist item using its S/N

=== Out Of Office Self-Service Management
* Get OOF Status for current user
* Set OOF Status for current user
* Add OOF Share with another user
