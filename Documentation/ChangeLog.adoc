== ChangeLog
=== v1.6.11
- Improved Error handling and corrected mistake in error messages.
- Added code to make sure that if a service instance property is not set, we still handle this correctly with either an exception or a expected default.
- The above two fixes are implemented to avoid a 'KeyNotFound' exception that isn't 100% confirmed to be resolved yet.
- Added functionality to set the process instance folio in the ProcessInstanceClient. This requires admin premissions on the process.

=== v1.6.10

- Added a UM Get Users Service Object. This can be used to replace the UMUser GetUsers method, which speeds up a number of things because this filters directly on the backend.
  It also shows that we can convert a SQL query to a AD query. it's a bit tricky with all the properties to match, this could be done easier. But we'll see where this functionality goes.
- Added functionality to define MULTIPLE LDAP's. Querying is done in Parallel.For-loop to not wait sequentually.

- Worklist SO - Remove ActivityOverdue column in the WorklistSO as it was not filled and this calculation can be done on the UI side.
- Worklist SO - Fill the Originaldestination column with the Allocated User field.
