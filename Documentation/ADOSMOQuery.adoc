== ADO SMO Query

Runs ADO queries against smartobjects. Main features:
* Supports multiple queries and creates separate service objects for each query
* Each service object contains properties with name and type returned by query
* Allows using input parameters and map them to input properties
  
=== General queries' rules:

* Multiple queries must be delimited with semicolon symbol ';'. E.g. [Query string 1];[Query string 2]
* Each query string can contain a custom name delimited from query command with pipe symbol '|'. E.g. "Super query|SELECT id, title FROM SmartObject1". Custom name will be used as name for the service object. If no custom name specified, then "Query [##]" will be used, where [#] is the ordinal number of query string
* To use smartobject's input properties as query conditions(filters), parameters should be specified as [@parName] after HAVING statement. E.g. "SELECT id,title HAVING id=@id"
