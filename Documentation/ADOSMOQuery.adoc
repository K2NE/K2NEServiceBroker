== ADO SMO Query

Runs ADO queries against smartobjects. Main features:
* Supports multiple queries and creates separate service objects for each query
* Each service object contains properties with name and type returned by query
* Allows using input parameters and map them to input properties
* Queries can be read from a xml file
  
=== General queries' rules:
==== Common rules
* Queries with star mask '*' in the fields list are supported: "SELECT * FROM SmO1"
* To use smartobject's input properties as query filters, parameters should be specified as [@parName] after WHERE\HAVING statement. E.g. "SELECT id,title FROM SmO1 WHERE id=@id". 
* Additional information about ADO.Net provider for smartobjects and queries: http://help.k2.com/onlinehelp/k2blackpearl/devref/current/default.htm#ADO_NET_Provider.htm

==== If using queries specified in the service object settings property ("Data queries delimited by ;"):
* Multiple queries must be delimited with semicolon symbol ';'. E.g. [Query string 1];[Query string 2]
* Each query string can contain a custom name delimited from query command with pipe symbol '|'. E.g. "Super query|SELECT id, title FROM SmO1". Custom name will be used as a name for the service object. If no custom name specified, then "Query [n]" will be used, where [n] is the ordinal number of query string

==== If using queries from the xml file:
* Specify the file path in the "SMO data queries file path" service object property.
* See sample xml file link:ADOSMOQuery.SampleQueries.xml[ADOSMOQuery.SampleQueries.xml] for more information
