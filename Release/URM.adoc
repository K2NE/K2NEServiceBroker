== URM
The URM folder is to replace the URM Service Broker that K2 provides out of the box. The current (we're in the 4.6.10 timeframe here) issue is that these Service Objects are often used but are not very performant.
Most people expirience issues with the Active Directory performance. The reason for this is that the Filter that is supplied from the User Interface (picker control and so on) is pass to the SMO, but the serivce broker does not utilize this filter.
This means that the Service Object code will retrieve /all/ the items in a Get List from the AD, which is just slow. There's nothing that K2 or any C# coder can change about that.

The URM Service Objects check if the label is 'K2' and if so, performs it's own filtered query against the AD, which is faster as the result set will be smaller and we utilize the indexes.
The service instance has an option to "Change Contains operator to StartsWith for AD" - this option by default is true as AD is not able to use indexes when it does a contains filter.

If the label is not 'K2' then the service broker will simply execute the originial method. This code is copied from reflector and therefor a bit messy and probably not well tested.

THere is also a Service Instance property to supply custom active Directory properties, for when you are using the K2 label. This allows one to read custom properties from the AD.
